## Tasks

Log analysis software will help, start analyzing a working node.

* Figure out how to run the ws [web-socket] server feed like the wss://arb1.arbitrum.io/feed or wss://rinkeby.arbitrum.io/feed . We are also looking for https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc 

* Yeah! found, analyzing the ws with 

```
â†’ websocat wss://rinkeby.arbitrum.io/feed > out                                                              [12efabf]
```

found the validator/arb-util/inbox/sequencerBatchItem.go , seems that the arb-rpc-node is using 

a private key was in arb-dev-sequencer.go

* just found they are using the https://github.com/gobwas/ws  (grep -inr --include \*.mod ws)


* Fix gas for dev-sequencer
