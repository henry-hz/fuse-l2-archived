Arbitrum Exploration
====================

 I started to document the exploration steps that are having success results, using two approaches, one directly deploying using the scripts, and other building every package by itself. I found a [deploy-guide](./DEPLOY_GUIDE.md) in the 0.8 tag of this repo documentation, and I am following it. Arbitrum cleaned this guide from their actual documentation to prevent clones :)


## How Arbitrum Works

* [tech-intro](https://medium.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/a-technical-introduction-to-arbitrums-optimistic-rollup-860955ea5fec) - best article around!
* [optimism-tech-intro](https://medium.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/an-introduction-to-optimisms-optimistic-rollup-8450f22629e8)
* [optimism-rollups](https://research.paradigm.xyz/optimism)
* [vitalik-incomplete-guide](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html)
* [getting-started-with-arbitrum](https://coinyuppie.com/getting-started-with-arbitrum-infrastructure-and-concepts/) - deep compare optimism with arbitrum


## Running Deploys

* [buld-steps](./BUILDS.md) - until now 10 commands worked, this doc is a sequence of deploys only from the root


Now Found that bridge_eth_addresses.json is on the .gitignore, so I am figuring out how to generate it


## Building

* [arb-avm](./ARB-AVM.md) - Succesfully built the CPP avm !
