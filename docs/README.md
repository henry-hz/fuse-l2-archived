Arbitrum Exploration
====================

 I started to document the exploration steps that are having success results, using two approaches, one directly deploying using the scripts, and other building every package by itself. I found a [deploy-guide](./DEPLOY_GUIDE.md) in the 0.8 tag of this repo documentation, and I am following it. Arbitrum cleaned this guide from their actual documentation to prevent clones :)


## Running Deploys

* [buld-steps](./BUILDS.md) - until now 10 commands worked, this doc is a sequence of deploys only from the root


Now Found that bridge_eth_addresses.json is on the .gitignore, so I am figuring out how to generate it


## Building

* [arb-avm](./ARB-AVM.md) - Succesfully built the CPP avm !
